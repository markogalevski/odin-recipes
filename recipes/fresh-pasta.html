	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>A fresh egg pasta which can be made quickly and rolled out either by hand or machine</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<p> per serving </p>
	<ul>
		<li>100g flour</li>
		<li>1 egg</li>
		<li>pinch of salt</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Pile your flour on your clean work surface and mix in your salt</li>
		<li>Create a deep well with your flour. You should see a lot of your work surface surrounded by a high walled ring
			of flour</li>
		<li>Crack in your eggs</li>
		<li>Start beating the eggs with a fork. Once it's one colour, start collapsing the well bit by bit into the eggs,
			beating all the while.</li>
		<li>Once the mixture becomes too thick to beat, it's time to knead</li>
		<li>Work the dough until it becomes a supple and tack like dough</li>
		<li>Wrap in cling foil/place in a small airtight container and let rest for 25min</li>
		<li>Roll out either with your pasta machine or a rolling pin.</li>
