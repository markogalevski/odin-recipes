  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Serves 4</p>
  <p>This is how Marco Guercini taught me to make carbonara. It's the very legit and real roman way, and not the
    americanised cream version.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 egg yolks</li>
    <li>black pepper</li>
    <li>200g pecorino romano</li>
    <li>150g fresh pasta per person (see my <a href="fresh-pasta.html" target="_blank">fresh pasta recipe</a>)</li>
    <li>100-150g guancale or bacon</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Set water to boil for the pasta. Salt the water VERY well.</li>
    <li>Chop up and fry the guancale/bacon in a hot pan. Drain the rendered fat and pieces into a separate bowl. Set
      aside.</li>
    <li>Beat the egg yolk with the finely grated pecorino and black pepper</li>
    <li>Once the water is boiling, add and cook the fresh pasta for 1-2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once it's ready, remove the pasta with tongs and add to the pan you cooked the guancale in.</li>
    <li>Add in half a ladle of pasta water and, after letting it cool very slightly, throw in your egg mixture</li>
    <li>Whisk and toss and turn like crazy to get an emulsion. The residual heat of the pasta should cook the egg
      without scrambling it</li>
    <li>Add in the guancale fat and stir once more.</li>
    <li>Plate, top with the guancale, some more pepper, and some more pecorino.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
